## Password Generator##

-- I decided to redo this assignment from scretch after I spent quite a bit time
to review the study works. The assignment was issued before the API 
section was taught. The better approches were implemented rather than basic JS methods.

-- I applied the DOM element querying, functions and js methods that I just
learned to make the coding more clean.

-- All special characters are inclued although some of them may not be ideal
for password in real world.

-- The given HTML and style sheet have been modified to make more appealing from the assignment.
